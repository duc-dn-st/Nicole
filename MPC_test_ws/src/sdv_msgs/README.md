# SDV Messages
This package contains the messages made for the SDV project.  
Three different messages are made, the *ControlReference.msg* which is used to send control commands to the steering and driving controllers, and the *TrajectoryPoint.msg* and *Trajectory.msg* which are used to send the trajectory to the task manager of the robot.
